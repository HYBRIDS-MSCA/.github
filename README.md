HYBRIDS: Hybrid Intelligence to monitor, promote and analyse transformations in good democracy practices.

Fake news, disinformation and hate speech online are pervasive and exacerbating societal tensions. Amidst growing concern that this harmful rhetoric is inciting violence and driving extremism, a global strategy to counter this digital phenomenon is more important than ever. In this context, the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions project HYBRIDS is working to provide researchers with the knowledge and tools they need to tackle disinformation. Specifically, it will integrate the structured knowledge provided by social and human sciences into natural language processing tools and deep learning algorithms. By developing new hybrid intelligence systems, HYBRIDS will combine machine and human intelligence to overcome the shortcomings of existing artificial intelligence methods.

This project has received funding from the Horizon Europe research and innovation programme under the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Grant Agreement No. 101073351 and from the UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) Horizon Europe funding guarantee - Grant Number: EP/X036758/1.
